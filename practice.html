    <h1>Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
    <h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>

    <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
      than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many      of the 
      residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>
