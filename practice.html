    <p class="important">Warning: we have no slow lorises here.</p>
    <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
      than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many      of the 
      residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>

    <p class="spacy">Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus

    <p class="tabbed">Whether you indent the first line of a paragraph or not, and how much you indent, is a matter of taste. Some designers prefer to separate paragraphs with whitespace, specifying bottom margins. Other designers like to indent the first line. Usually, when one method is used, the other method is not used.</p>
    <blockquote class="enclosed">
    <p class="enclosed">By default, a blockquote is set in. 
      Optionally, you can also style it, 
      as I do here by specifying grey in the CSS. 
      Frequently, designers also change the size of blockquote text, 
      making it either smaller or larger than normal text. 
      And, of course, you can change the font-family if you want to. 
      But avoid fancy fonts, please.</p>
